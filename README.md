How to run
----------

The application is managed by using `manage.py` script, run it to look through the available options.
Currently it allows to:

* purge the data from the database;
* run the application.

TODO

What could be added:

* validation of actor names before inserting to the database;
* unit tests for resources, services and API util functions;
* Swagger integration;
* dependency inversion/injection to make current implementation more looking like Clear architecture.
